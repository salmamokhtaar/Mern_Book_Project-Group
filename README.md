This project is a group-based web application developed as part of the final defense for a professional course at the university. The system is designed to function as a fully operational online bookstore, allowing users to browse, search, and download books. It features user authentication, book management (add/update/delete), category filtering, and secure access to PDF resources.

The project showcases the team's ability to apply full-stack development skills using modern technologies such as MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js (MERN stack). The frontend is responsive and user-friendly, while the backend handles data management and JWT-based authentication
